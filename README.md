# Nurse meter
Currently this app uses static data to show graphs of said nursing trends.

This repo contains two clients which essentially do the same thing. It started out with a react-client as that's what I was most familiar with at the time. The wife and I just wanted a way to see trends in nursing data that we were tracking with [Baby Tracker](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/baby-tracker-newborn-log/id779656557?mt=8)

Subsequently I was interested in brushing up on my angular skills and seeing how ionic works, so am adding a second client to that end.
